# Marriage Rates in the US

## MOTIVATION:
Marriage rates have been dropping over the past 20 years due to a number of sociological factors. I set out to analyze marriage rates within the US and how select states from  different regions and demographics of the US differ and relate to the national average. The states and reasons for which I have chosen them are as follows: Nevada (gnerally looser laws than the rest of the nation, Southwest), Washington (Pacific Northwest), Indiana (Midwest), Mississippi (South), Connecticut (Northeast)
